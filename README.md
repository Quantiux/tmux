# tmux config

This repo contains my configuration files for [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki).
Screenshot below shows the tmux statusline at the top (custom designed to match my [Neovim](https://github.com/Quantiux/nvim) statusline at the bottom). I use terminal in full-screen mode, so it helps to have the extra info boxes showing system load, system temperature, weather and date+time.
